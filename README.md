# 🥤 Sentiment Analysis of Coca-Cola Social Media Comments  
### High-Accuracy ML System Using USE Embeddings + ExtraTrees

This project builds a sentiment classification model to analyze customer comments about the **Coca-Cola** brand.  
The goal: classify each comment as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.

We achieved a final accuracy of **88.88%** using a lightweight yet powerful combination of:

- **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)** → deep semantic text embeddings  
- **ExtraTrees Classifier** → robust, fast, high-performing traditional ML  
- **60:40 Train-Test Split**  
- **Detailed visual evaluations (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)**  

This system demonstrates that *classic ML + modern embeddings* can outperform many transformer-free baselines, making it ideal for academic, research, and real-world applications.
